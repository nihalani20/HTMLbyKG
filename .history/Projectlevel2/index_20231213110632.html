  <h1>Rajyoga Meditation</h1>
  <h2>What is <b>Rajyoga Meditation</b></h2>
  <img>
  <p>‘Raja’ means ruler and ‘Yoga’ refers to ‘communion’. So, Rajyoga is a divine communion which makes us self sovereign.
  Meditation comes from the Latin word- Mederi which means to heal. Rajyoga Meditation is thus a self-healing process. By
  practicing it, our eyes open to a totally new world- a world inside, activating our dormant inner energies in the form
  of powers and nourishing the spiritual awareness of the self, Supreme, time and world. Once we start exploring this
  inner world, we find the root of our problems and also the key to their solutions. We start to respond to situations,
  rather than just reacting to them and begin to live in harmony.</p>
